Source code to CartLife, by Richard Hofmeier.

About: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cart_Life

Cart Life is a simulation video game developed by Richard Hofmeier using Adventure Game Studio for Microsoft Windows released in May 2011. The game was added to Steam in March 2013 but later removed when Hofmeier released the full source code for free. The game is designed on a pixel-grid in grayscale, with minimal detail, to better allow the player to deduct the mood of each of the three vendor characters.

In Cart Life the player controls one of three street vendors, and attempts to run their shop whilst looking after their health, interests, and families.

The game was received well by critics, with particular praise for the relatable characters, though some critics criticised technical issues. In 2013 Cart Life won the Independent Games Festival Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Nuovo Award, and Excellence in Narrative award.

You will need [Adventure Game Studio](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/) to edit, compile, and run this.

## Binaries / Game Downloads

I put some binaries, as well as a clone of this repository, up on SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cartlife/

## Building

This was originally written in AGS 3.2.1; It compiles and runs now in AGS 3.4.0, which has some improvements over 3.2.1.  

You will need to decompress the multi-part .rar file `acpsprset_DECOMPRESSME.*.rar` to get teh acpsprset, which is the sprites file.

## Contributing

There are quite a few bugs people have discovered in CartLife; you are invited to document these in detail, and/or do anything towards solving them.  Open an "issue" here on GitHub.  There are some things referenced in forums on Steam, etc., which may be a useful place to start: https://github.com/gondur/cartlife_src/issues/2

The code is quite messy and needs lots of refactoring, and even just formatting to be readable; as RH notes in the code:
```
// It's clear that, at the time of making this game and writing all of this mind-cancer-inducing code, I was
// new to scripting and was only guessing at how to make things work. What takes cart life hundreds of thousands
// of lines of scripting could be done in a few dozen by a more astute author. But, despite the immeasurable shame
// I feel when I glance back over this shit, I remember that I only learned what I know through looking at the
// attempts made by other authors. If they hadn't granted me the chance to peek under the hoods of their creations,
// I could never have even started to forge my own. It's my dearest hope that any of this is of use to someone.
// BEST OF LUCK, PIONEER!
// -Richard
```

I am following something akin to the PSR-2 standard (as close as practicable in this language) as a style guide and standard to follow when going through this code. http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/

This doesn't include most of the music, of course, since it was composed and performed by people who aren't me. Please contact them for permission: MAT64: http://www.cervellomeccanico.com/ POCKETMASTER: http://www.pocketmaster.ch/ STU: http://stu.atari.org/ LO-BAT: http://www.lo-bat.be/

ALSO: This game uses the font "HOOGE" by Nicholay Dubina and Craig Kroeger, which I can't give you permission to use, probably. Best to ask Craig, instead. http://miniml.com/fonts/
